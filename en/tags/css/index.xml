      <description>Source Code at Github
This small responsive page only use HTML and CSS. I made it for ICS118 mid-term project, but it was also my first time using video tag in HTML.
I learned how to do media query and z-index better through making this webpage. It was a good practice at that time.
The video used in the project come from Offical Nintendo Youtube Channel
