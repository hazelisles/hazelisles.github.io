      <description>Source Code at Github
This is my first collaborative project. I worked with 2 teammates in 2 weeks implementing Agile Approach for developing a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) responsive social website which the main idea and design are trying to clone basic feature of twitter.
In this experience, I learned:  How to deal with conflicting code How to create branch to develop features then pull request on github asking review and merge to main project Review teammates&amp;rsquo; code and give feedback  My main assignments include:  Features and front-end pages of register, login, logout All pages and functions of back management stage such as view all users and administrator status, delete specific tweets, etc.</description>
