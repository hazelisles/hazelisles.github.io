      <description>This is not my first time try to build my own website, but finally make it on-line. In the end of last semester, I actually finish my own ePortfolio through WordPress. It was on-line through school&amp;rsquo;s WordPress account. I was also quite satisfied of my hard work. However, everything got deleted accidentally by a school technician.
Eventhough I felt upset and kind of mad. Well, how can I say. That&amp;rsquo;s it!</description>
