      <description>This is not my first time try to build my own website, but finally make it on-line again.
In the end of last semester (Dec 2021), I actually finished my own ePortfolio through WordPress. It was on-line through school&amp;rsquo;s WordPress account. I was also quite satisfied of my hard work. However, everything got deleted accidentally by a school technician ðŸ˜± ðŸ˜± ðŸ˜±
