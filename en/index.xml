      <description>This is not my first time try to build my own website, but finally make it on-line. In the end of last semester, I actually finish my own ePortfolio through WordPress. It was on-line through school&amp;rsquo;s WordPress account. I was also quite satisfied of my hard work. However, everything got deleted accidentally by a school technician.
Eventhough I felt upset and kind of mad. Well, how can I say. That&amp;rsquo;s it!</description>

This small responsive page only use HTML and CSS. I made it for ICS118 mid-term project, but it was also my first time using video tag in HTML.
I learned how to do media query and z-index better through making this webpage. It was a good practice at that time.
The video used in the project come from Offical Nintendo Youtube Channel

This is my first collaborative project. I worked with 2 teammates in 2 weeks implementing Agile Approach for developing a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) responsive social website which the main idea and design are trying to clone basic feature of twitter.
In this experience, I learned:  How to deal with conflicting code How to create branch to develop features then pull request on github asking review and merge to main project Review teammates&amp;rsquo; code and give feedback  My main assignments include:  Features and front-end pages of register, login, logout All pages and functions of back management stage such as view all users and administrator status, delete specific tweets, etc.</description>
